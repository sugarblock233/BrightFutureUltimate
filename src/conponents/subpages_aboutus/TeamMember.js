                    </h3>
                    <li className="indent-8">
                        Junzhao, often the strategic mind behind our initiatives, hails from
                        China and is pursuing his studies at HFU. His ability to see the bigger
                        picture and plan meticulously makes him an invaluable asset to Bright
                        Future. Junzhao’s dedication to helping fellow students is rooted in his
                        own experiences and challenges he faced as an international student. His
                        insight into academic support systems is pivotal in shaping our tutoring
                        programs.

                        international students face. Ran’s empathy and approachability make her
                        perfect for her role in organizing events and workshops that bring
                        students together. She believes strongly in the power of a supportive
                        community and works tirelessly to ensure no student feels isolated in
                        their journey.
